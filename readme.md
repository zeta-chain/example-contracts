## Overview

Welcome to the ZetaChain example contracts repository! This collection of smart
contract projects is written using Hardhat and Solidity, specifically for the
ZetaChain blockchain. Each project showcases different functionalities and use
cases that can be implemented on the ZetaChain platform.

### Omnichain Contracts

The `omnichain` directory contains omnichain contracts. Omnichain is a unique
interoperability feature of ZetaChain that allows you to write and deploy a
single contract that can manage assets on all connected blockchains. Learn more
about
[omnichain contracts in the docs](https://www.zetachain.com/docs/developers/omnichain/overview/).

### Cross-Chain Messaging

The `messaging` directory contains contracts that demonstrate the ability to
send data and value between blockchains using cross-chain transactions, without
the need for warpped assets and bridges. Learn more about
[cross-chain messaging in the docs](https://www.zetachain.com/docs/developers/cross-chain-messaging/overview/).

## Tutorials

If you are new to ZetaChain and would like to learn how to use these example
contracts, check out
[the developer section in the docs](https://www.zetachain.com/docs/developers/overview/).
The tutorials provide step-by-step instructions on setting up your development
environment, deploying contracts, and interacting with the ZetaChain network.
