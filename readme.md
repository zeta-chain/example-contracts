## Overview

Welcome to the ZetaChain example contracts repository! This collection of smart
contract projects is written using Hardhat and Solidity, specifically for the
ZetaChain blockchain. Each project showcases different functionalities and use
cases that can be implemented on the ZetaChain platform.

### Universal Apps

The `omnichain` directory contains universal omnichain contracts. A universal
app is a smart contract on ZetaChain that is natively connected to other
blockchains like Ethereum, BNB and Bitcoin. Learn more about [universal apps in
the docs](https://www.zetachain.com/docs/developers/apps/intro/).

## Tutorials

If you are new to ZetaChain and would like to learn how to use these example
contracts, check out [the Tutorial section in the
docs](https://www.zetachain.com/docs/developers/tutorials/hello/). These
tutorials provide step-by-step instructions on setting up your development
environment, deploying contracts, and interacting with the ZetaChain network.
