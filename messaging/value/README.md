# Template for a ZetaChain Hardhat Project

This is a simple Hardhat template that provides a starting point for developing
smart contract applications on the ZetaChain blockchain.

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, ensure that you have
[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download) and [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)
installed on your system.

## Getting Started

To get started, install the necessary dependencies:

```
yarn
```

## Hardhat Tasks

This template includes Hardhat tasks that can be used make it easier to build
with ZetaChain.

### Generating a Random Wallet

To generate a random wallet:

```
npx hardhat account --save
```

This command generates a random wallet, prints information about the wallet to
the terminal, and saves the private key to a `.env` file to make it accessible
to Hardhat. If you don't want to save the wallet (for example, if you just need
an address to send tokens to for testing purposes), you can run the command
without the `--save` flag.

### Querying for Token Balances

To query for token balances:

```
npx hardhat balances
```

This command queries token balances for the account address derived from the
private key specified in the `.env`.

If you want to query for token balances for a different account, you can use the
`--address` flag:

```
npx hardhat balances --address ADDRESS
```

### Requesting Tokens from the Faucet

To request ZETA tokens from the faucet:

```
npx hardhat faucet
```

This command requests tokens from the faucet for the account address derived
from the private key specified in the `.env`. Tokens sent to the address on
ZetaChain. To specify a different chain use a flag:

```
npx hardhat faucet --chain goerli_testnet
```

You can also specify a different address to send the tokens to:

```
npx hardhat faucet --address ADDRESS
```

Alternatively, you can install a standalone faucet CLI:

```
yarn global add @zetachain/faucet-cli@athens3
```

You can then use it with the following command:

```
zetafaucet -h
```

### Creating an Omnichain Contract

To create a new omnichain contract:

```
npx hardhat omnichain MyContract
```

This command creates a new omnichain contract in `contracts/MyContract.sol`, a
task to deploy the contract in `tasks/deploy.ts`, and a task to interact with
the contract in `tasks/interact.ts`.

When an omnichain contract is called, it can receive data in the `data` field of
a transaction. This data is passed to the `message` parameter of the contract's
`onCrossChainCall` function. To specify the fields of the `message` parameter,
use positional arguments:

```
npx hardhat omnichain MyContract recepient:address description quantity:uint256
```

A field may have a type specified after the field name, separated by a colon. If
no type is specified, the type defaults to `bytes32`.

Learn more about omnichain contracts by following the
[tutorials](https://www.zetachain.com/docs/developers/omnichain/tutorials/hello/).

### Tracking a Cross-Chain Transaction

After broadcasting a cross-chain transaction on a connected chain either to a
cross-chain messaging contract or to trigger an omnichain contract, you can
track its status:

```
npx hardhat cctx --tx TX_HASH
```

### Verifying a Contract

To verify a contract deployed on ZetaChain:

```
npx hardhat verify:zeta --contract ADDRESS
```

Select the contract to verify:

```
? Select a contract to verify: (Use arrow keys)
  @zetachain/zevm-protocol-contracts/contracts/interfaces/IZRC20.sol:IZRC20
  @zetachain/zevm-protocol-contracts/contracts/interfaces/zContract.sol:zContract
‚ùØ contracts/Withdraw.sol:Withdraw
```

After the confirmation the contract will be verified.

### Sending Tokens

Sending ZETA from ZetaChain to Goerli:

```
npx hardhat send-zeta --amount 1 --network zeta_testnet --destination goerli_testnet
```

Sending ZETA from Goerli to ZetaChain:

```
npx hardhat send-zeta --amount 1 --network goerli_testnet --destination zeta_testnet
```

Depositing gETH to ZetaChain as ZRC-20:

```
npx hardhat send-zrc20 --amount 1 --network goerli_testnet --destination zeta_testnet
```

Withdrawing ZRC-20 from ZetaChain go Goerli as gETH:

```
npx hardhat send-zrc20 --amount 1 --network zeta_testnet --destination goerli_testnet
```

Depositing tBTC from the Bitcoin testnet to ZetaChain:

```
npx hardhat send-btc --amount 1 --recipient TSS_ADDRESS --memo RECIPIENT_ADDRESS_WITHOUT_0x
```
